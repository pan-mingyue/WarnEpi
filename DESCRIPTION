Description: 
    Infectious disease surveillance requires early outbreak detection. This
    package provides statistical tools for analyzing time-series monitoring 
    data through three core methods: 
    a) EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
    b) Modified-CUSUM (Modified Cumulative Sum)
    c) Adjusted-Serfling models
    Methodologies are based on:
    - Wang et al. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2009.08.003>
    - Wang et al. (2015) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0119923>
    Designed for epidemiologists and public health researchers working with
    disease surveillance systems.
